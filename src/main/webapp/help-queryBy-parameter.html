    Filter vulnerabilities in this build based on the value of the APPVERSIONTAG environment variable. This requires the application version reported by the Contrast agent match the value of APPVERSIONTAG.<br>
    It may be necessary to override the value reported by the agent at runtime. For example, with the Java agent: -Dcontrast.override.appversion=v1.2.3 .
